Se realizó 6 ejercicios usando mapas de México
1) Get a polygons map of the lowest administrative unit possible. Get a table of variables for those units. At least 3 numerical variables. Preprocess both tables and get them ready for merging. Do the merging, making the changes needed so that you keep the most rows.
2) Compute the neighbors of the capital city of your country. Plot the results for each of the options.
3) Compute the Moran's coefficient for one of your three numeric variables.Make a scatter plot for each variable.
4) Compute the Local Moran for the variables in your data that have significant spatial correlation.Create a new column for each of those variables, with a label ('0 no_sig', '1 hotSpot', '2 coldOutlier', '3 coldSpot', '4 hotOutlier').Prepare a map for each of the variables analyzed, showing the spots and outliers.
5) Use your three variables to carry out the cluster/regional analysis.
6) Use your three variables to carry out regression analysis (conventional and spatial).
